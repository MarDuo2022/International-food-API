Team members: Zalak, Marisa and Sandra

Project Description:

What should I eat today? Recipe to Cook.
•	Provide quick Chef recipe to cook in your own time.
•	Coming home tired from work and long day, we aim to use our codes to instantly provide the recipes that meet our requirements.

Our requirements could include: 
1)Time limit of 30 minutes, so we can spend more time with families and on entertainment and less time on cooking. 
2)Use specific ingredients to cook which you have at home, so we can have homemade food after work.
3)The outputs of this project should provide specific practical recipes (could be of different cuisine) for us to cook for our family.

Research questions to Answer:
1.	Which recipe(s) can be prepared under 30 min?
2.	Which recipe(s) belongs to Italian/Indian/Chinese cuisine?
3.	Which recipe(s) include certain ingredients (already in fridge), exclude certain ingredients (e.g., carrots)?
4.	Which recipe(s) is suitable for particular dietary requirements (e.g., vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free)?
BONUS: 
1)substitute for ingredients (if we don't have carrots, what else can we use for the recipe)?
2) Big picture (map, bar chart) – Different recipe comparison based on preparation time
3)plan meals (DataFrames) for the entire week

Datasets:
This dataset allows us to search through thousands of recipes using advanced filtering and ranking. NOTE: Since this method combines searching by query, by ingredients, and by nutrients into one endpoint, each request counts as 3 requests.
1)	https://rapidapi.com/category/Food
2)	https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition/ 

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1)	Make API Call
2)	Set Parameters
3)	For inclusion/exclusion of ingredients, which cuisine
4)	Time limit of recipe
5)	Print recipe results
6)	Statistics on how long different types of cuisine might have.
7)	[BONUS] construct Meal plans for the week
